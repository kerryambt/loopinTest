A project for a job interview at Loopin.

A component displays a prompt asking you for your mood today. You have three options, and can click to submit. The component changes colour, displays different text and icons, and prompts you of your mood for the day.

Extensions to the original spec allow the date to be changed, mood to be added for any day, and for mood on any day to be edited.

Project was boilerplated using CRA. You can clone then install using npm (or yarn if you prefer) install, then npm start to run.

if (thisProjectIsGood) setMood("happy");

:D
