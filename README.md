A project for a job interview at Loopin. It should ask a user for their mood, and output that mood along with the current date.

Project was boilerplated using CRA. You can clone then install using npm (or yarn if you prefer) install, then npm start to run.

if (thisProjectIsGood) setMood("happy");

:D
